# prairie-operator
The Prairie Operator manages home agents deployed in a kubernetes cluster.

## Description
Prairie Operator aims to deploy a specified amount of home agents (HA) for use in an ip6 network context. An example configuration is the following:

```
apiVersion: prairie.kismi/v1
kind: HomeAgent
metadata:
  name: ha-sample
spec:
  size: 2
```

In the example above we created a HomeAgent pool named ha-sample and specified its size to be 2. This means that 2 HomeAgents will be deployed on the network their address can be found in the status fields of the HomeAgent instance under "Nodes".

Deployed instances can be reached via client containers found at kismi/mo-client:latest by running the cl.out executable and supplying it with the specified home agent's ip6 address.

An example:
```sh
./cl.out 2001:db8::1
```

After that a new interface should appear called ip6tun0 on which you can start communicating with the HA. The HA's ip6 address is always the first address available on the subnet of the ip6tun0 address.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/prairie-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/prairie-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
